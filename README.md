# Motocross Wheel Visualization

![Example image](public/ExampleImage.png)

## Description

This project is a 3D visualization of motocross wheels using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and React Three Fiber (`@react-three/fiber`). The goal is to display both front and rear wheels with the ability for users to dynamically change colors on various wheel parts such as the hub, spokes, rim, and nipples.

The models are loaded from GLB files and use textures, including specular maps for enhanced material effects. Colors can be updated in real-time via UI controls, and the wheels rotate continuously with camera orbit controls enabled.

## Features

- Real-time 3D rendering of front and rear motocross wheels.

- Dynamic color customization for different wheel parts:

  - Hub

  - Spokes

  - Rim

  - Nipples

ðŸ”œ Color settings can also be passed through URL parameters.

## Technologies

- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)

- [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
